Research on grid-forming control is a crucial aspect of modern power systems, especially with the integration of renewable energy sources and the need for resilient and stable grid operation. Our goal is to develop new ways to manage power grids that can handle the challenges of today's world, like integrating renewable energy sources and ensuring stability during sudden changes in demand. Our approach is rooted in a deep understanding of both the traditional principles of power systems engineering and the cutting-edge advancements in artificial intelligence and control theory. By combining the best of both worlds, we aim to develop innovative solutions that address the complex challenges of modern power grids.
