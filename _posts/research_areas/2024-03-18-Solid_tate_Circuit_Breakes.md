The research work on DC circuit breakers focuses on the development of Solid State Circuit Breakers (SSCBs) for the protection of existing and emerging direct current (DC) power systems such as Electric Vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, commercial and naval vessels, aviation power distribution, railway power systems, data centers, power converter and battery protection, Photo-Voltaic (PV) Systems and the future residential DC grid. DC-SSCBs based on thyristor (SCR) as well as Wide-Band Gap (WBG) based Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET topologies are actively being developed in the lab.
