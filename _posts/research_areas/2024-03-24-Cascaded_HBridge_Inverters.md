As renewable energy generation continues to grow steadily, the significance of multilevel inverters, particularly cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) ones, has seen a surge in recent years owing to their numerous benefits in industrial and grid-connected setups. However, the uneven distribution of power from photovoltaic modules to each phase of the inverter due to varying irradiance levels and ambient temperatures can result in asymmetric grid currents. To address this challenge, we develop several computationally efficient pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques to achieve balanced power distribution and thermal stress across each module of both symmetric and asymmetric CHB inverters
