This research centers around developing an AC-DC converter topologies for power factor correction with minimal losses. As soft switching of all switching devices in such a topology requires additional circuitry, investigatons are carried out regarding the trade-offs to be made in the design of said topologies. Taking the application of EV chargers, AC-DC converters allows G2V power flow with minimal losses. For G2V and V2G, a bidirectional soft switched power factor correction topology is being researched.
