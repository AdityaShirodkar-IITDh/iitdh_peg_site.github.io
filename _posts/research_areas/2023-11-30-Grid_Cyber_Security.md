In our lab, we're leading the charge in developing an advanced cyber security test bed tailored specifically for the complex smart grid environment. With a keen focus on enhancing security measures surrounding the Wide Area Damping Control System (WADCS) and Automatic Generation Control (AGC), we harness cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and dynamic state estimation techniques to detect cyber attacks with precision. Integrating industry-standard protocols such as IEEE C37.118 and IEC61850 into our OPLRT test bed, we craft a comprehensive defense strategy. Through meticulous simulation of real-world scenarios, our aim is to fortify smart grid infrastructures, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyber threats. Driven by a commitment to innovation, we strive to pioneer solutions that uphold the reliability and security of future energy networks.
