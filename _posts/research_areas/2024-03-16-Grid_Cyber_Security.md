In our lab, we're leading the charge in developing an advanced cyber security test bed tailored specifically for the complex smart grid environment. With a keen focus on enhancing security measures surrounding the Wide Area Damping Control System (WADCS) and Automatic Generation Control (AGC), we harness cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, and dynamic state estimation techniques to detect cyber attacks with precision. Integrating industry-standard protocols such as IEEE C37.118 and IEC61850 into our OPLRT test bed, we craft a comprehensive defense strategies, ensuring the resilience of smart grids against evolving cyber threats.
